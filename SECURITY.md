# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Essencium is not maintained in multiple versions. Only the latest release is developed further and any vulnerabilities are fixed. The developers are happy to provide support when migrating to the latest version.

## How to Report a Bug or Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, do not open an issue. Instead, please email us at essencium@frachtwerk.de directly, so we can address it promptly and confidentially. For reporting non-security-related bugs, we appreciate if you can use our bug report template, which provides a structured format for gathering essential information to reproduce and understand the issue.
