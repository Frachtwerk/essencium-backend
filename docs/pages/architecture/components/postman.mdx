## Postman

Postman is a tool for developing and testing APIs. With Postman Collections, you can organize your API requests and elements.
A Postman Collection is a group of API requests that are already saved in Postman and can be arranged into folders. Grouping similar requests into folders and collections helps you better organize and document your requests .

You can also generate collections from API schemas to view and edit each request. With Postman Collections, you can also add API elements like mocks, monitors, and tests to your APIs . You can share your collections via documentation, the Run in Postman button, or by link . Postman Collections are executable API descriptions .
