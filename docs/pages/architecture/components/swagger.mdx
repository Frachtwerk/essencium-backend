## Documenting REST API

Swagger UI is an open-source tool that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services.
It is built on top of the OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger Specification) and provides a user interface for interacting with APIs.

[Here](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-rest-openapi-documentation) is a tutorial on Baeldung that explains how to document a Spring REST API using OpenAPI 3.0 1. The tutorial explains how to use SpringDoc, which simplifies the generation and maintenance of API docs based on the OpenAPI 3 specification for Spring Boot 3.x applications. It also provides information on how to set up springdoc-openapi and how to integrate it with Swagger UI to interact with the API specification and exercise the endpoints.
