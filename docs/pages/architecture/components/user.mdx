## User Management
The user-specific classes in the code serve to manage user data and operations in the system, including creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving users.

1. `AbstractUserController`: This class sets up the HTTP endpoints for user management under `/v1/users`. It provides the ability to perform operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, deleting users, as well as managing session termination. It also caters to the currently authenticated user with specific endpoints.

2. `UserDto`: This Data Transfer Object is responsible for carrying user-specific data between various processes. With fields like `id`, `email`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `phone`, `mobile`, `password`, `locale`, and `roles`, it aids in handling data during creating and updating operations.

3. `AbstractBaseUser`: Serving as the model, this class extends the `AbstractBaseModel` and implements the `UserDetails` interface, providing fundamental fields and methods necessary to handle user data.

4. `AbstractUserService`: This abstract class serves as the service layer, providing crucial methods for pre-processing and post-processing during creation and updating of users. The service includes methods for password sanitization, role resolution, conversion from DTO to entity, and specific operations for the currently logged-in user like self-update and password updating. It also has a method for generating a nonce, creating a default user, and converting a Principal object into a user.

Combined, these classes provide a comprehensive structure for managing users in the system - from the HTTP interface down to data handling and processing logic. This makes user management secure, efficient, and flexible to handle various user-related requirements.
