# In-Depth Guide to Essnecium Dependencies

> **Note Paul:** Ich habe mal noch die wesentlichen Dependencies (teilweise nur mit Überschrift) aufgenommen und bein paar Anmerkungen vorgenommen.

In this post, we'll dive deeper into the specific dependencies that you may encounter in an Essencium project. Dependencies streamline the development process by reducing the amount of boilerplate code, freeing up developers to focus more on business logic.

## spring-boot-starter-parent

## Spring Boot Properties Migrator

`spring-boot-properties-migrator` is a special dependency introduced to smoothen the transition between major Spring Boot versions, such as migrating from Spring Boot 2.7.x to 3.0.y and later. As Spring Boot evolves, certain properties can get renamed, removed, or otherwise altered. This library provides a mechanism to ease this migration by suggesting the necessary changes to your `application.properties` or `application.yml` files to match the new version.

## Spring Boot Starter Actuator

`spring-boot-starter-actuator` is part of the Spring Boot project. It provides several production-ready features out of the box, such as monitoring and managing your application. With it, you can expose operational information of your application like metrics, audit, health, HTTP trace, info, loggers, and more through HTTP endpoints or JMX. This module is very useful to understand the running application's behavior in a production environment.

## Spring Boot Starter Cache

The `spring-boot-starter-cache` dependency abstracts and simplifies the implementation of caching within a Spring Boot application. This dependency allows you to easily integrate with a variety of caching implementations such as EhCache, Hazelcast, Infinispan, Couchbase, Redis, Caffeine, and more. It also supports the JSR-107 (JCache) annotations.

> `It also supports the JSR-107 (JCache) annotations.` würde ich weglassen.

## Spring Boot Starter Data JPA

`spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` is a starter kit that simplifies the usage of the Spring Data JPA project. It is an abstraction layer on top of the JPA (Java Persistence API), which simplifies database interaction using ORM (Object Relational Mapping) concepts. It provides functionality such as CRUD operations, pagination, and sorting, all out-of-the-box.

## Spring Boot Starter Security

Security is a crucial aspect of any application. `spring-boot-starter-security` provides default configurations and simplifies the integration of Spring Security within a Spring Boot application. It helps developers handle various security aspects of an application, like authentication, authorization, protection against attacks (like session fixation, clickjacking, etc.), and many other security features.

## Spring Boot Starter Web

`spring-boot-starter-web` is a cornerstone for developing web applications, including RESTful applications, using Spring MVC. It brings in a suite of dependencies required for web development, such as embedded Tomcat server, Spring MVC, Jackson for JSON binding, Validator, and others. This starter makes the process of building a web application straightforward.

## Spring Boot Starter Validation

Data validation is a common task in most applications. The `spring-boot-starter-validation` dependency provides support for Java Bean Validation with Hibernate Validator. It allows the use of standard validation annotations (JSR-303/JSR-349) in your model classes to maintain data integrity.

> **Note Paul:** `It allows the use of standard validation annotations (JSR-303/JSR-349) in your model classes to maintain data integrity.` würde ich weg lassen. Stattdessen wäre eine Passage wie die folgende sinnvoller:
>
> ```m̀d
> Some of the most common validation annotations are:
> - @NotNull: to say that a field must not be null.
> - @NotEmpty: to say that a list field must not empty.
> - @NotBlank: to say that a string field must not be the empty string (i.e. it must have at least one character).
> - @Min and @Max: to say that a numerical field is only valid when it’s value is above or below a certain value.
> - @Pattern: to say that a string field is only valid when it matches a certain regular expression.
> - @Email: to say that a string field must be a valid email address.
> ```

## Spring Boot Configuration Processor

The `spring-boot-configuration-processor` is used to generate metadata for your configuration properties at compile time. It aids IDEs by providing auto-completion features when working with `application.properties` or `application.yml` files. Although this is an optional dependency, it provides a significant boost to developer productivity.

> **Note Paul:** Classes annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties` are automatically detected by the Spring Boot Configuration Processor and the metadata is generated.

Continuing from the previous section, let's dive into the remaining Spring Boot dependencies.

> **Note Paul:** Diese Überleitung würde ich weglassen.

## Spring Boot Starter OAuth2 Resource Server

`spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server` is a starter for using Spring Security's OAuth2 resource server. It enables a Spring Boot application to act as a resource server in an OAuth 2.0 setup, which means it can serve protected resources to clients providing a valid access token.

## Spring Boot Starter OAuth2 Client

`spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client` is a starter for using Spring Security's OAuth2 client. It facilitates the OAuth 2.0 "Client" role in a way that a Spring Boot application can interact with OAuth 2.0-secured servers.

## Spring Boot Starter HATEOAS

`spring-boot-starter-hateoas` provides a library to ease creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle. This principle makes your RESTful services self-discoverable. Clients interact with a REST application entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers.

> **Note Paul:** Essencium Backend uses this dependency to provide an annotation called `@RestrictAccessToOwnedEntities` which allows you to restrict access to entities only to the user who are linked to this entity in a way you can define.

## Spring Boot Starter Freemarker

`spring-boot-starter-freemarker` is a starter for building MVC web applications using FreeMarker views. FreeMarker is a template engine: a Java library to generate text output (HTML web pages, e-mails, configuration files, source code, etc.) based on templates and changing data.

> **Note Paul:** Essecium Backend uses this dependency to provide a Freemarker template for sending emails.

## Spring Beans and Spring Core

`spring-beans` and `spring-core` are fundamental parts of Spring Framework. The Core package provides the basic parts of the framework, including the IoC and Dependency Injection features. The Beans package builds on this to provide a range of utilities for working with beans and the IoC container.

> **Note Paul:** IoC = Inversion of Control

## SnakeYAML

SnakeYAML is a YAML parser and emitter for the Java programming language. YAML, which stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language", is a human-friendly data serialization standard. It's often used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored.

> **Note Paul:** SnakeYAML muss denke ich nicht separat aufgeführt werden, da es von Spring Boot Starter Web mitgebracht wird ... nur aktuell in einer verwundbaren Version. Mit anderen Worten: Diese Dependency fliegt raus, sobald Spring Boot auf die neue Veriosn umsteigt.

## Spring Boot Starter Test

`spring-boot-starter-test` is a starter for testing Spring Boot applications with libraries including JUnit, Hamcrest, and Mockito. It also excludes `junit-vintage-engine` to avoid running JUnit 4 based tests.

## Spring Security Test

`spring-security-test` contains test utilities for Spring Security. It simplifies testing Spring Security within your application by providing useful annotations and utilities.

## WireMock

WireMock is a simulator for HTTP-based APIs. It allows you to stay productive when an API you depend on doesn't exist or isn't complete.

## H2 and PostgreSQL Dependencies

The `h2` and `postgresql` dependencies bring in the respective JDBC drivers which allow your application to connect to these databases.

> **Note Paul:** Vielleicht geben wir die noch mit `provided` (oder sogar gar nicht...) an. In einer Anwendung kann dann jeder selbst entscheiden welche Datenbank angebunden werden soll.

## UnboundID LDAPSdk

UnboundID LDAPSdk is a fast, comprehensive, and easy-to-use Java API for communicating with LDAP directory servers and performing related tasks like reading and writing LDIF, encoding and decoding data using base64, and ASN.1 BER.

> **Note Paul:** The [UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java](https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/index.html) is a fast, powerful, user-friendly, and completely free Java library for communicating with LDAP directory servers.

## SpringDoc OpenAPI

The `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui` starter enables automated generation of API documentation using the OpenAPI specification. It generates documentation in a format that can be read and interpreted by Swagger UI.

## Apache HttpClient



## Jakarta Mail

This is a mailing library, providing capabilities to send emails from Java applications using SMTP, POP3, and IMAP. The `jakarta.mail` dependency helps to send and receive emails, making it possible to build mailing features in your Spring Boot applications.

## Lombok

Lombok is a library that helps to reduce boilerplate code by providing annotations to generate common methods, such as getters, setters, toString, and hashCode. It also provides annotations to generate constructors and builders.
