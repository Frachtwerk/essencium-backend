## Spring Boot Layers

The `essencium-backend` in a Spring Boot project encapsulates a multi-layered architecture that organizes the application into several logical components. These layers promote separation of concerns and modular design, leading to more maintainable and scalable applications. Here's an overview of each layer:

### `configuration`

This layer is responsible for configuring the Spring Boot application's settings. It could involve setting up database connections, configuring security parameters, intialize Data and defining beans that the application will use. It often includes `@Configuration` classes and property files.

### `controller`

The controller layer, often marked with `@Controller` or `@RestController` annotations, is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning responses. It's the entry point for client requests and delegates the requests to corresponding services for processing. In the controller layer, user requests are also checked on the basis of a role and rights concept. The controller layer is also known as the presentation layer.

### `model`

The model layer represents the domain objects or entities in the application. These are the classes that map to the database and define the structure of the data that the application will handle. In a typical Spring Boot application, entities are often annotated with `@Entity`.

### `repository`

The repository layer is responsible for providing a mechanism to perform database operations (usually CRUD operations, CRUD = create, read, update, delete). Essencium backend uses Spring Data JPA to provide an interface to the database. All major relational database systems are supported.  The repository layer is also known as the persistence layer.

### `security`

The security layer manages the security aspects of the application, such as user authentication and authorization. This includes the configuration of Spring Security, the definition of user roles and permissions, and the handling of secure communication protocols. The connection to external authentication providers (LDAP, OAuth) also belongs to this layer.

### `service`

The service layer, marked with `@Service` annotation, contains the business logic of the application. It processes requests from the controller, interacts with the repository layer for data manipulation, and returns the data back to the controller.

### `util`

The util (or utility) layer typically contains various utility classes and helper functions that are used throughout the application. This may include string manipulation functions, date and time helpers, file handling utilities, and more.

This layered structure of the `essencium-backend` follows the typical architecture of a Spring Boot application, promoting good design principles like separation of concerns and modular design, making the application easier to develop, maintain, and scale.
