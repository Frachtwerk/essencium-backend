## Spring Boot Layers

The `essencium-backend` in a Spring Boot project encapsulates a multi-layered architecture that organizes the application into several logical components. These layers promote separation of concerns and modular design, leading to more maintainable and scalable applications.

### `configuration`

The configuration layer is not really a full application layer. It contains some default configurations (web security, scheduling, password strength, LDAP and OAuth2 configurations, ...) as well as some default initializers that ensure that users, roles, rights and translations are loaded correctly at application startup. Most of these configurations and initializers can be extended on the application side to meet individual project requirements.

### `controller`

The controller layer is responsible for processing incoming HTTP requests and returning responses. It is the entry point for client requests and delegates the requests to lower layers (service layer) for processing. User requests are also checked in the controller layer on the basis of a role and rights concept. Essencium offers ready-made implementations for processing user, role, rights and translation entities. Various abstract controller implementations are also available, which make it easier to set up additional controllers. Complex authorization concepts can be implemented quickly and clearly using Essencium's own annotations.

### `model`

The model level represents the domain objects or entities in the application. These are the classes that are mapped to the database and define the structure of the data that the application will process. By using DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for inbound and outbound data transfer, Essencium makes it possible to use your own representations and thus, for example, validate incoming data or enrich outgoing data with additional information.

### `repository`

The repository layer is responsible for providing a mechanism to perform database operations (usually CRUD operations, CRUD = create, read, update, delete). Essencium backend uses Spring Data JPA to provide an interface to the database. All major relational database systems are supported.

### `security`

The security layer manages the security aspects of the application, such as user authentication and authorization. This includes the configuration of Spring Security, the definition of user roles and permissions, and the handling of secure communication protocols. The connection to external authentication providers (LDAP, OAuth) also belongs to this layer.

### `service`

The service layer, marked with `@Service` annotation, contains the business logic of the application. It processes requests from the controller, interacts with the repository layer for data manipulation, and returns the data back to the controller.

### `util`

The util (or utility) layer typically contains various utility classes and helper functions that are used throughout the application. This may include string manipulation functions, date and time helpers, file handling utilities, and more.

This layered structure of the `essencium-backend` follows the typical architecture of a Spring Boot application, promoting good design principles like separation of concerns and modular design, making the application easier to develop, maintain, and scale.
