# Code Style and Linting

## Java Code Formatting

The Essencium Backend follows standard Java conventions and Spring Boot best practices for code organization and formatting.

### Lombok Usage

Lombok is used throughout the project to reduce boilerplate code by providing annotations to generate common methods:
- `@Getter` and `@Setter` for accessor methods
- `@ToString` for string representation
- `@EqualsAndHashCode` for equality checks
- `@NoArgsConstructor`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, `@RequiredArgsConstructor` for constructors
- `@Builder` for builder pattern
- `@Data` as a shortcut for common annotations
- `@Slf4j` for logging

### Spring Annotations

Use appropriate Spring annotations for dependency injection and configuration:
- `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller` for bean definitions
- `@Autowired` for dependency injection (constructor injection preferred)
- `@Configuration` for configuration classes
- `@Bean` for bean factory methods
- `@Value` for property injection
- `@ConfigurationProperties` for type-safe configuration

### General Code Conventions

- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use interfaces for contracts and abstraction
- Follow SOLID principles
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Use appropriate logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
