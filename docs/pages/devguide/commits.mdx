# Git Commit Messages

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- When only changing documentation, include [ci skip] in the commit title
