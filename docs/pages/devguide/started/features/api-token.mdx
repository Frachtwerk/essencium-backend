## Api Token

Essencium provides a simple and secure way to authenticate users using API tokens. This feature is especially useful for applications that require user authentication but do only need a simple set of rights. Therefor the ApiTokenUser was created.

### ApiTokenUser

- ApiTokenUsers are linked to one AppUser.
- The username of the ApiTokenUser is combined from the username of the AppUser and an unique identifier (UUID) separated by a colon (`:`).
- If the Username of the AppUser changes, the ApiTokenUser will be deleted.
- An ApiTokenUser only can have rights that have been granted to the AppUser.
- If an AppUser is deleted, all ApiTokenUsers will be deleted as well.
- On creation a Bearer Token will be generated and returned. This token is needed to authenticate the ApiTokenUser. This token is only returned once and will not be stored in the database.
