## [Sentry Configuration and Endpoint Overview](https://sentry.io/)

This document provides more in-depth instructions and context for configuring Sentry, a popular error tracking tool. It details setting Sentry properties in the `application.yaml` file, container stacks, version tracking, and introducing a new endpoint.

### Configuration in `application.yaml`

To enable Sentry in your application, configure the following properties in your `application.yaml`:

- `api_url`: The URL of your Sentry API. This URL is where your application will send error reports and other Sentry-related requests.
- `organization`: The name of your organization on Sentry. This will help Sentry categorize and manage error reports sent from your application.
- `project`: The name of your project on Sentry. Sentry will use this to further categorize and manage your error reports.
- `environment`, `token` and `dsn` should be set in the Container Stacks

```yaml copy
sentry:
  api_url: https://sentry.io/api/
  organization: my-organization
  project: my-project
```

You can find other Configurations in the `application.yaml`(Version tracking `release: @project.version@`)

### Feedback Function

`v1/sentry/feedback` Post-Endpoint

- The `eventId` refers to the Sentry Issue Id.
