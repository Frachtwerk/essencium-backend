## Implementations
For an easier development process and increase its efficiency, we suggest implementing and extending the following classes:

- **`AbstractModel`**
- **`ModelSpec`**
- **`AssemblingService`**
- **`DefaultAssemblingEntityService`**

All these classes, when implemented correctly, can help in maintaining a clean architecture, reducing code redundancy, and making your development process more comfortable.

### AbstractModel
The `AbstractModel` is typically a general or base model which provides a structure for more specific models. It includes common properties or methods that other models can inherit, making it easier to manage and maintain your code.

```java copy
public abstract class AbstractModel extends SequenceIdModel {}
```

### ModelSpec
`ModelSpec`, on the other hand, is a specification for a model, defining its properties, structure, and behavior. This provides a clear guideline for what each model should look like, enabling consistency and reducing the risk of errors.

```java copy
public interface ModelSpec<T extends SequenceIdModel> extends BaseModelSpec<T, Long> {}
```

### AssemblingService
`AssemblingService` is designed to encapsulate the logic for assembling the various components of a model. This reduces dependencies between components and makes it easier to test and modify individual parts of your software.

```java copy
public interface AssemblingService<M extends AbstractBaseModel, R> {

  AbstractRepresentationAssembler<M, R> getAssembler();

  default R toOutput(M entity) {
    return getAssembler().toModel(entity);
  }

  default Page<R> toOutput(Page<M> page) {
    if (page == null) {
      return null;
    }
    return page.map(this::toOutput);
  }
}
```

### DefaultAssemblingEntityService
`DefaultAssemblingEntityService` can be seen as an extension of `AssemblingService`, offering default or common assembling functionality. This helps in reducing the redundancy of your code and makes it easier to manage.

```java copy
public abstract class DefaultAssemblingEntityService<M extends SequenceIdModel, IN, OUT>
        extends AbstractEntityService<M, Long, IN> implements AssemblingService<M, OUT> {

  @Getter private final AbstractRepresentationAssembler<M, OUT> assembler;

  protected DefaultAssemblingEntityService(
          final AbstractRepository<M> repository,
          final AbstractRepresentationAssembler<M, OUT> assembler) {
    super(repository);
    this.assembler = assembler;
  }
}
```
