## Getting Started

This guide will show you how to use essencium-backend in your project. The integration involves a few simple steps, primarily setting up the Spring Boot framework in your project.

### Setting-Up Spring-Boot

To avoid compatibility issues, we recommend using the same Spring Boot version as the `essencium-backend`.

Add the following lines to your pom.xml file, replacing `@{spring.version}` with the specific Spring Boot version that essencium-backend uses:

```xml copy
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>@{spring.version}</version>
</parent>
```

Please refer to the official [Spring Boot documentation](/references/springdoc) for more details on setting up Spring Boot in your project.

### Implementing Essencium-Backend

Once you've set up Spring Boot, you can start implementing `essencium-backend`. We've broken down the process into several steps, outlined in the following sections, to make it easier for you to integrate `essencium-backend` into your project.

In case you encounter any issues during the integration process, don't hesitate to contact us. We're more than happy to assist you.
