 * @deprecated Due to breaking changes in Hibernate, the previous option to let the database
 *     determine the choice of id sequence is no longer available. The 'native' strategy has been
 *     modified so that it is still compatible with existing PostgreSQL-based projects. For new
 *     projects, the classes <a href="./SequenceIdModel">SequenceIdModel</a> and <a
 *     href="./SequenceIdModel">IdentityIdModel</a> should be used.
