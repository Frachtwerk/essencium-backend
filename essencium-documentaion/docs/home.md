# Welcome to Essencium Backend

Essencium is a software library that was originally developed for client projects. It is based on Spring Boot and allows developers to quickly start new software projects. After its initial use in client projects, Essencium has now been made open source, making it accessible to a wider range of developers and promoting collaborative development. It is developed by Frachtwerk GmbH.
